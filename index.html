Hey Chinni, my sweetheart 💑,

Love you Chinni 💖, my heart, my everything…

From the very first moment I saw you in the cafeteria 🍽️, something inside me changed forever. That was the day I fell for your beautiful eyes 👀, and soon after… your soft, magical voice 🎶. Day by day, I fell for your character, your heart, your soul, big fam pf your dance ❤️. You became the one I couldn’t stop thinking about.

Our metro journeys 🚇 together were not just travel—they were magic ✨. Every morning I used to wait just to see you, and that one glimpse of you would make my entire day ☀️. We’d listen to Hejjegondhu Hejje and Maathu nannovlu mounanu nannavlu together with smiles on our faces and hearts full of warmth. Even watching that silly Salman Khan song (Aae haae haae… Tujhe Aksa Beach ghumaa du… Aa chalti kya?) made everything feel lighter and happier 🕺💃. With you, everything felt like a second, but every second was unforgettable 🕰️.

The day you gifted me Simba🦁 on my birthday 🎂—that wasn’t just a gift, it was a piece of your love that I’ve kept close to my heart ever since. And yes, I still use the same gym bag 🎒 you gave me—because it’s not just a bag, it’s you, with me every single day. I’ll be honest… I was really heartbroken the day you didn’t come to my birthday 🥺, but that never changed what you mean to me. You’re too precious, and love doesn’t keep scores—it just stays.

Our time at work together was golden 🏢. Having lunch 🍱, dinner 🍽️, sharing laughter, admiration, helping you with tips and assessments—it all made me feel complete. You used to come to me for guidance, and little did you know, you were teaching me how to love. The day you left the company felt like a nightmare 🌧️—like something just broke inside me. But that’s when I truly understood how deeply I’m connected to you.

Even after that, we never really drifted. You were always there, every day, like the heartbeat in my chest 💓. We played games online 🎮, waited for each other before sleeping 🌙, laughed, talked, shared life. I admired your bravery, how you stood strong with your family, even in the toughest times. And all I wanted, and still want, is to be your person, the one who never leaves, the one who stays—no matter what 🤝.

There’s still so much I want to tell you… things that’ll make you smile, blush, and fall in love with me all over again—but those secrets are for our wedding night 💍. Till then, stay curious and keep your heart ready for surprises 🎁.

I know how deeply I care for you, how much I want to protect you like my own soul 🛡️. I’ve seen your love—genuine, raw, beautiful—in your eyes 👁️‍🗨️, and I feel it every day. We will be together forever as husband and wife, no matter what life throws at us. Just one request—never leave me and go. You know how much I love you… you’ve felt it. And I know, without a doubt, that we’re meant to be 👫.

I love you, Sukku ❤️
I love you, Chinni 💞
You are my now, my forever, my dream, my everything.

Let’s walk through life hand in hand, soul in soul, heart in heart 💑.

Love you till my last breath… and beyond ♾️
💖🥺


      <p>Your faith, your love, your lovable Manu🦁</p>
